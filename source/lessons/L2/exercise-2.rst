**Due date:** Please complete this exercise by Sunday **2 weeks** after the exercise has been released (i.e. by Sunday 19th November).

.. admonition:: Exercise 2 - Start your assignment

    You can start working on your personal (private) copy of Exercise 2 by:

    - `accepting the GitHub Classroom assignment <https://classroom.github.com/a/HibvOsCz>`__.

Notice that if you are using GitHub Classroom for the first time, it might ask from you a permission to verify your GitHub identity.
In such case, choose "Authorize GitHub Classroom". You can also take a look at the open course copy of `Exercise 2 in the course GitHub repository <https://github.com/Spatial-Analytics-2023/Exercise-2>`__ (does not require logging in).
Note that you should not try to make changes to this copy of the exercise, but rather only to the copy available via GitHub Classroom.
